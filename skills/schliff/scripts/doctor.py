    A plugin that is both cached and vendored appears twice on disk, so the

    ``shared.skill_payload_digest``.

    Why a digest and not another ``EXCLUDED_DIRS`` entry — the path exclusion
    was measured and rejected — plus the before/after numbers: docs/specs/2026-08-13-doctor-counts-vendored-skills.md,
    "Amendment 2026-08-26".

    Nothing is deleted; every path in a group is reported and the caller decides
    (ADR 0019). The counted copy is the first in discovery order, which sorts by
    path. Sort order is not merit, and which member it favours depends on the
    directories being scanned, so no member may be named by a runnable command:
    the row for a group carries no ``action`` that acts on a path. Preferring a
    member on any other basis would need a path wordlist — the enumeration this
    key exists to avoid.

    What the group asserts is bounded by what the digest reads. Two members can
    differ in anything outside SKILL.md, ``references/*.md`` and
    ``eval-suite.json`` — including their version, and including whether both are
    live installs. The report states the comparison and never concludes from it.

    One helper because the same two-line omission produced five defects in this
    area. Both halves matter and both were learned the hard way:

    * **Regular file, checked first.** ``read_text`` on a FIFO blocks forever —
      measured, still hung after six seconds — and on a character device it reads
      until memory runs out. ``st_size`` is 0 for both, so a size gate alone lets
      them through. doctor walks directories that belong to other people, so a
      plugin can put either where a skill file is expected.
    * **Size before read, not after.** Reading first raises ``MemoryError`` on a
      multi-gigabyte target, and ``MemoryError`` is not ``OSError`` and not
      ``ValueError``. That was survivable while every caller sat inside
      ``_score_single_skill``'s handler; it stopped being survivable when the
      digest began reading these files before the scoring loop.

    Returns ``None`` when the file cannot or should not be read, alongside a
    short, path-free reason. Callers treat the ``None`` as "no content", never
    as an error to propagate; the reason exists because collapsing "too large"
    and "unreadable" into one word told the reader to repair a file whose only
    problem was its size.

    **The checks run on the descriptor, not on the path.** ``is_file()`` then
    ``stat()`` then ``read_text()`` leaves two windows in which the path can be
    swapped for a FIFO after the check and before the open — and anyone who can
    plant the FIFO can also win that race, so under this function's own threat
    model the hang it exists to prevent stayed reachable. ``O_NONBLOCK`` makes
    the open itself return instead of waiting for a writer, and ``fstat`` then
    describes the exact object that is about to be read. ``read_skill_safe``
    resolves the same race the other way (read first, size after), which it can
    afford because it does not need the size before the read; here the size gate
    is the point, so the descriptor is the only honest thing to measure.

    One enumeration, two consumers: ``estimate_token_cost`` charges for these
    files and ``skill_payload_digest`` hashes them. They were hand-mirrored,
    guard for guard, which is the shape that already produced several defects in
    this area — a domain re-derived instead of asked for.

    **Symlinks are rejected**, unlike ``read_skill_safe`` and ``load_eval_suite``
    which follow them. The asymmetry is deliberate and it is a shipped security
    fix: "symlink rejection on ``references/`` directory and files in
    ``estimate_token_cost``". doctor walks directories that belong to other
    people, so a plugin can put whatever it likes in ``references/``; following a
    link there turns a word count into a filesystem oracle, and reading before
    the size check turns a link to a huge file into an OOM. ``skill_mesh``
    confines resolved SKILL.md paths to the scan root and ``structure``'s ref
    linter requires refs to resolve back inside their base, for the same reason.

    **The scope of the check, stated exactly:** ``is_symlink()`` tests the last
    component, which is enough to stop a reference escaping the directory. It
    does NOT stop a ``references/`` reached *through* a symlinked skill
    directory — ``is_dir()`` resolves everything above. That is the caller's
    confinement to make, and ``discover_skills`` makes it (``relative_to`` the
    scan root), so a default run cannot reach it; ``--skill-dirs <link>`` and an
    explicit ``score``/``bench`` path can, and there the caller named the link.
    A ``realpath`` check here would be dead code: the base resolves with the
    target, so it can never fail. Measured before writing that down.

    I briefly reversed this to make a stow layout collapse with its plain twin,
    on the strength of a fixture I had written myself. Measured afterwards over
    the real installation: **0 symlinks across the 41 skills that have a
    ``references/`` directory**. The cost of the reversal was real and the case
    it bought was not, so the rejection stands. If a field case ever appears, the
    fix is confinement plus a ``stat().st_size`` check before the read — not a
    bare ``resolve()``.

    reads them.

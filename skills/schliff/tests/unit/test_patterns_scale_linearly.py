"""Empirical ReDoS gate: no compiled scoring pattern may scale super-linearly.

This is the test that would have found the 2026-07-30 audit's findings on its own.
Static shape-triage did not: "any unbounded quantifier on a character class" flagged 47
of the 102 patterns in `scoring/patterns/*` and isolated neither of the two that mattered,
because the shape that actually blew up has no nesting and no overlapping alternation —
just an unbounded run before a required literal.

Method: warm each pattern, then time `.search()` against a family of pathological
filler alphabets at two sizes one doubling apart. On the RAW scale linear patterns
come in near 2.0x and the measured defects at 3.9x-4.1x — margins too close to
separate reliably on a loaded runner.

The ratio is therefore CALIBRATED: divided by the ratio of a known-linear scan of
the same input, measured in the same process, so runner speed divides out. On that
scale healthy patterns measure ~1.05 (max 1.08) and the defect class 2.05-2.28 idle,
and the threshold is 1.5x — see `_MAX_RATIO`. An absolute floor still applies. A
loaded runner CAN still flake it: the divisor is measured apart from the pattern, so
sustained contention does not divide out (13 of 88 CI attempts in 2026-08/09; under
sixteen busy processes the divisor spreads 1.6-4.5 and the defect class reads under
1.5 in about one reading in twelve) — see the spec's 2026-09-05/07 amendment, #233
and #234.

Known limit, stated rather than glossed: this gate reaches exactly as far as its filler
alphabet. That is not hypothetical — `manifest._FM` was quadratic on a frontmatter-shaped
input at 3.95x per doubling while every generic filler came in at 1.85x, below the
absolute floor, so the gate shipped blind to a live defect for one commit. The two
`frontmatter_*` fillers close that specific shape; a shape nobody has thought of yet
still stays invisible. The `_MIN_ABS_SECONDS` floor has the same character: it suppresses
noise, and it would also suppress a quadratic with a very small constant at this size.

The lesson generalises: when a defect is found by hand, add the filler that would have
found it. The alphabet is the gate.

Cost: ~10-25s. That is the price of the only gate here that does not depend on a
heuristic being right. Its deterministic companion is `test_patterns_are_bounded.py`.

    A single `re.search` of the calibrator costs ~0.8 microseconds — three orders
    of magnitude under `_MIN_ABS_SECONDS`, the floor this file applies to every
    other measurement because below it noise dominates. So each timing is a
    window of `n` scans, `n` grown until a window clears the floor.

    Two defences against the field record in the spec's 2026-09-05/07 amendment
    (docs/specs/2026-07-30-redos-audit-fixes.md). The first version took ONE
    window per size and returned as soon as it cleared the floor — which a
    scheduler stall does by itself, so a stall in the accepted window became the
    divisor for every pattern. Now each size is the FASTEST of `windows` windows,
    for the same reason `_best_of` takes a minimum: a stall only ever adds time;
    and `n` is accepted only once the fastest small window clears the floor, so
    a stall cannot make an undersized window look long enough either.

    Second, the small and large windows are INTERLEAVED (small, large, small,
    large, ...) rather than all-small then all-large. The minimum is still taken
    per side, so the windows are not paired: what interleaving buys is that a
    burst shorter than a round can leave each side a clean window, where the
    sequential order left one side none. Both sides run `n` scans, so a large
    window is about twice as long as a small one and a short burst is that much
    likelier to land in one — sizing the large side to the floor on its own is
    a companion of #233. Interleaving is not a defence against contention that
    covers most of a round: a burst that leaves a side no clean window moves
    the divisor in either order. The plausibility band does not catch that
    residual — it was set wide enough to contain the loaded range, and every
    divisor implicated in the field reds lies inside it — which is why the
    residual is #233's, not this function's.

    """One scheduler stall must not become the divisor for 224 patterns.

    The field record — 13 red attempts in 88, a divisor of 7.29 and one of 0.19
    on a scan that is linear by construction, cached for every pattern of the
    pair — is in the spec's 2026-09-05/07 amendment. This pins the mechanism
    that answers it, on a fully virtual clock so the verdict is exact and the
    same on every runner.

    A probe "pattern" advances the clock by 1.0 per scan of the small text and
    2.0 per scan of the large one — a linear scan, divisor exactly 2.0 — and
    adds a stall the size of the floor inside the first small window and inside
    the last large window of EVERY round of `windows` pairs. Every round,
    because the round the calibrator accepts is the one whose windows become
    the divisor. Two positions, because a stalled small window is what tempts
    "any window clears the floor", and a stalled last large window is what
    "take the last window" would read; a stall on both sides is what a mean or
    a maximum would average in, and only the fastest window per side ignores it.

    An unstalled 64-scan small window measures 64 and is rejected for either
    floor; the stalled one clears it and must not be accepted. The second
    round's size is the documented formula, stated here as its two outcomes:
    at floor 100 the doubling floor wins (128), at floor 400 the estimate does
    (500). The floors divide the work: only floor 100 catches "accept once the
    LARGE window clears the floor" (at 400 the large side rejects round one
    too), and only floor 400 catches a wrong estimate (at 100 the doubling
    floor hides it). The single assertion on `seen` pins the interleaving
    order, both round sizes and the exit; the pair assertion pins the divisor.

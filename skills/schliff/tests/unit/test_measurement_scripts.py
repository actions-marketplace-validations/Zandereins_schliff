"""Guards for the two measurement scripts, which had none.

Every refusal in `freeze_corpus.py` and `run_measurement.py` was itself a defect
found in review — a freeze that covered the wrong file set, a drift verdict for a
typo'd path, a record written for a run the script declared failed. They are
load-bearing for a one-shot, date-pinned measurement, and nothing exercised them.

The drift classifier deserves particular attention: it is a string-prefix
heuristic over another process's stdout, so renaming a label in
`freeze_corpus.verify` would silently turn every drift into "the freeze check
itself failed" — the opposite verdict, with no test to notice.

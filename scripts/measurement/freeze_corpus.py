"""Freeze the measurement corpus, and verify a frozen one later.

The published field number ("N skills, X tokens") is measured against
`~/.claude`, which is not in any repository and which plugin updates rewrite on
their own schedule. Measured: 159 SKILL.md on 2026-08-29, 161 on 2026-08-31
after an update ran at 08:37 that morning. Without a frozen list, a number
published on 2026-09-14 cannot be reproduced by anyone, including its author.

Two domains, kept apart on purpose:

* **Which files count** belongs to the modules that own them, called here rather
  than re-derived: `skill_mesh.discover_skills` for which skills exist, and
  `shared._payload_files` plus the loader's `eval-suite.json` path for which
  files each skill's numbers are computed from.

  Getting that second half wrong is what the first version of this file did. It
  hashed SKILL.md alone, while `estimate_token_cost` and `skill_payload_digest`
  also read `references/*.md` and `eval-suite.json`. Measured: rewriting one
  reference moved a skill from 26 to 3,925 tokens and changed its payload digest
  while `verify` reported `0 drifted` and exited 0. A freeze whose domain is
  smaller than the quantity it indexes is not a freeze — the same defect this
  repository fixed in `skill_payload_digest` itself.
* **What the bytes were** belongs to this file. It hashes the raw bytes with a
  full sha256, NOT `discover_skills`' own `content_hash`, which is truncated to
  16 characters and computed over content that schliff has already decoded and
  BOM-stripped. That hash is an identity for schliff's deduplication; it is not
  a file fingerprint, and it would tie the freeze to a reader that changed twice
  in the week this was written. A freeze must not depend on the tool it freezes.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/measurement/freeze_corpus.py write  docs/.../corpus.jsonl
    python3 scripts/measurement/freeze_corpus.py verify docs/.../corpus.jsonl

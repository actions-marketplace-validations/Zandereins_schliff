# ADR 0017: Score-neutral behaviour changes ship as a minor release

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-06

## Context

The credential gate introduces a new failure condition: a build that is green today can turn
red tomorrow. `action.yml:22-25` shows `schliff-version` defaulting to `''`, so Action users
pick up the change on their next run without acting. Pre-commit users are pinned through
`rev:` and move only when they bump.

That looks like grounds for a major. It is not, because of what the change deliberately does
not touch.

## Decision

Ship as **8.11.0**, a minor. Three separate pull requests — F3 (the gate), F1 (the gradient
target check and the split), F4 (the redaction patterns) — landing in one release.

The policy this sets: score-neutral changes ship as minors; a change that moves the composite
would be a major.

Required alongside the release:

- a CHANGELOG entry under an explicit **BREAKING BEHAVIOUR** heading, not under *Added*
- a CLI test proving the red path: `verify` exits non-zero on a credential fixture. The
  matching `action-selftest.yml` fixture is a **post-release follow-up** and cannot be part of
  this release — see ADR 0014 for why
- the README pinning recommendation raised to the new version
- the **three version constants** moved in lockstep, since
  `tests/unit/test_version_consistency.py` asserts all three are equal and fails the build
  otherwise: `pyproject.toml:7`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json:3`, and
  `skills/schliff/__init__.py:3` — the last is the value `schliff version` actually prints
  (`cli.py:1009`, reading `__version__` per `cli.py:41`), and an earlier draft omitted it
- separately, the **README/docs occurrences** including the badge cache-bust. These are
  cosmetic and untested, which is why they are not one of the three constants

## Why

ADR 0011 made the gate score-neutral precisely so the version contract would survive it.
Composites, badges, comparisons and every pinned `--min-score` threshold behave identically
before and after. What changes is one narrow failure condition that fires only where a
structurally valid vendor token is present — and there, a red build is the correct answer, not
a contract violation.

New detection rules in minor releases is the established convention for linters; Ruff ships
them the same way. A major would signal that scores or interfaces moved, provoking exactly the
migration anxiety that score-neutrality was chosen to avoid.

The CHANGELOG heading carries the honesty the version number does not. Filing a new red-build
condition under *Added* would be the mislabelling this project's conventions exist to prevent.

Three PRs rather than one because the gate — with its Action change and self-test fixture —
needs a fundamentally different review from a regex addition in `evolve/sanitize.py`.

## Rejected

**Major 9.0.0.** Signals a score or interface break that did not happen, and invites everyone
to audit a migration that consists of nothing.

**One combined PR.** Bundles an unrelated regex change into a review that should concentrate on
a security gate and a CI surface.

**Three separate releases.** Three lockstep version bumps and three badge cache-busts for two
internal changes nobody can observe from outside.

## Amendment 2026-09-15 — what "moves the composite" means

Release 8.12.0 raises the composite of non-SKILL formats (a bare AGENTS.md 17.4 → 35.0)
because `dashboard.py` and `auto-improve.py` stopped counting an unlisted dimension as
zero, and lowers no file's score relative to 8.11.1 (measured across 171 field files, see
the CHANGELOG notes). Read literally, the decision above would make that a major. The rule
is restated as it was meant: **a change that lowers any file's score, or moves a pinned
`--min-score` verdict from pass to fail, is a major; a correction that only raises scores
ships as a minor with the movement disclosed in the CHANGELOG.** The reason is the same as
in *Why*: a major signals a migration, and there is none to make when nothing that passed
starts failing.
